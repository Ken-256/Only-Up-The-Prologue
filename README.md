Only Up: The Prologue, draws its inspiration from the highly acclaimed platformer known as Only Up, hailed by many as one of the most challenging games in its class. The original game is no longer available on the Steam marketplace, though it has left a mark on the fans. So we took this as an opportunity to reimagine it and bring it to life with more intense difficulty levels and captivating gameplay that keeps players on their toes. With hope, Only Up: The Prologue will be equally challenging and unforgettable both for advanced players and beginners. Good luck, and have a good climb!

Developed with Unreal Engine 5
